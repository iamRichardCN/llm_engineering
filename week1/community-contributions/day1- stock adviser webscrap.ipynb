Instead, consider investing in established, dividend-paying companies such as:\\n1. **Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)**: A consumer goods giant that can withstand tariff pressures due to its diverse product line and steady demand.\\n2. **Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)**: A strong pharmaceutical company with a history of stable dividends and a diverse portfolio that mitigates risk from tariff-related issues.\\n3. **Coca-Cola Co. (KO)**: With a robust global presence, Coca-Cola can handle tariff fluctuations well while offering attractive dividends.\\n\\nThe big picture: The market is currently experiencing turbulence due to trade uncertainties, but strong, dividend-paying companies remain stable.\\n\\nYour game plan: Split your $100 by investing $30 in PG, $30 in JNJ, and $30 in KO, leaving $10 as a cushion for future investments or to reinvest in any of these stocks after learning more about their performance.\""
